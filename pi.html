    <h2>What is Performance Improvement?</h2>
    <p>Considering that achieving project objectives will occur over time and that differing conditions will be exposed, including detrimental variability from various sources, a process to continuously improve performance must be put in place. To achieve this, SPS|PM provides access to a variety of Reports, Decision-Support Mechanisms and Analytics that, if effectively used, will contribute to expose performance improvement opportunities based on actual project production data. Effective use of these Reports, Decision-Support Mechanisms and Analytics enables project teams to improve process designs, identify and address sources of variability, reduce cycle times and work-in-process and achieve optimal throughput and capacity utilization.</p>
    <p>This section provides a detailed description of SPS|PM Reports, Decision-Support Mechanisms, and Analytics including why they are important, how they work, how to interpret the data and what to do to access them.</p>
